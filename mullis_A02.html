Assignment #2: Business Intelligence

For this assignment, imagine that you're experimenting with name-your-own-price revenue models.
You've just run a quick promotion that sold 1,000 widgets, and now you'd like to form some conclusions about what your customers thought they were worth.

var profitLoss = totalSales - prodCost;
