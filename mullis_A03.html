Assignment #3: Shakedown Tour
Objects are like arrays, but with named properties instead of numbered items.
1. Load this script file to create a quakes variable containing an array of earthquake objects.
2. Practice looping thru objects (associative arrays) to examine the following info:

Each object has the same properties:
    src: which station detected the quake
    region: where the quake was generally located
    long and lat: the coordinates where the quake originated
    magnitude: the size of the earthquake 

Using loops to examine all of the earthquakes in the list, answer the following questions:
    What was the highest magnitude quake, and where was it located?
    How many earthquakes had a magnitude higher than 4.0?
    How many earthquakes took place in the "Seattle-Tacoma urban area, Washington"?
     (Be careful with the spelling and capitalization--it must be exact.)
